## 9. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Q1: What is the difference between the Gemini model versions?
A1: The Gemini model versions (gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, gemini-1.5-pro-exp-0801) offer different balances of speed, capability, and experimental features. The "flash" version is optimized for quick responses, while the "pro" versions offer more advanced capabilities. The experimental version may include cutting-edge features but might be less stable.

### Q2: How do I choose the right temperature setting?
A2: The temperature setting (0.0 to 1.5) affects the creativity and randomness of the AI's output. Lower values (closer to 0) produce more focused and deterministic responses, while higher values (closer to 1.5) generate more diverse and creative outputs. Experiment with different values to find the right balance for your specific use case.

### Q3: What file types can I analyze with the application?
A3: The application supports analysis of CSV, TXT, MD (Markdown), and PDF files. Each file type is processed differently to extract its content for analysis.
